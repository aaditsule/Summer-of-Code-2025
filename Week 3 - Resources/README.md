# Intro to ML

Firstly, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DEL6SVRPw0) basic Intro Video.
1. [What is Machine Learning?](https://www.edureka.co/blog/what-is-machine-learning/)
2. [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.edureka.co/blog/mathematics-for-machine-learning/)
3. [Basic Intro and Terminologies](https://www.edureka.co/blog/introduction-to-machine-learning/)

## Supervised Learning
1. [What is supervised learning?](https://www.edureka.co/blog/supervised-learning/)
2. [Simple Linear Regression](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/everything-you-need-to-know-about-linear-regression/) and it's [python implementation](https://edureka.co/blog/linear-regression-for-machine-learning/#example)
3. [Multiple Linear Regression(MLR)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/multiple-linear-regression-using-python-and-scikit-learn/) and it's [python implementation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/emineyetm/multiple-linear-regression-in-python)
4. Firstly watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIYKR4sgzI8) then refer [Classification](https://www.edureka.co/blog/classification-algorithms/) and it's [implementation](https://www.edureka.co/blog/classification-in-machine-learning/) (Just Logistic Regression Part)
6. [Overfitting problem in ML](https://www.edureka.co/blog/overfitting-in-machine-learning/) and it's [solution](https://www.edureka.co/blog/regularization-in-machine-learning/)

## Unsupervised Learning
1. [What is unsupervised learning?](https://www.edureka.co/blog/unsupervised-learning/).  
Content provided below(K-means clustering and neighbours) is just if you want to learn more, It's Not required for this Course though.
2. [K-means clustering](https://www.edureka.co/blog/k-means-clustering-algorithm/).
3. [K-Nearest Neighbours](https://www.edureka.co/blog/k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm/)
